## [1.0.0] â€“ 2025-05-30

### Added
- Full graphical UI for analyzing geometric shapes using Tkinter and Matplotlib
- Support for:
  - Circle
  - Ellipse (with eccentricity and golden ratio check)
  - Triangle (with angle detection and triangle classification)
  - Rectangle (with golden ratio detection)
  - Regular Polygon (with radius, side length, and perimeter logic)
  - Irregular Polygon with custom vertex input
  - Spirals (Archimedean, Logarithmic, Fermat, and Hyperbolic)
- Visualizer with optional annotations and export to PNG
- Summary output for all shapes with detailed metrics
- Irregular Polygon enhancements:
  - Accepts multiple input formats for vertices
  - Handles self-intersecting polygons and computes correct area using Shapely
- Spiral enhancements:
  - Accurate arc length calculation (analytical or numerical depending on type)
  - Final radius and coordinates of spiral endpoint
- Shape Comparison window:
  - Compare any two analyzed shapes side-by-side
  - Smart key matching for fields like Perimeter vs Circumference
- Graph Export:
  - Save clean image or image with metrics summary
  - Batch export (all or selected shapes)
- UI features:
  - Dynamic window tiling based on monitor resolution
  - Scrollable canvas with automatic layout
  - Golden Ratio detection across supported shapes
  - Button and font styling
  - Help tooltips for custom input (e.g., irregular polygon syntax)
