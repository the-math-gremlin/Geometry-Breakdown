# üìê Geometry Breakdown

**Version 1.0 ‚Äî MIT Licensed**

Geometry Breakdown is a desktop tool for visualizing and analyzing geometric shapes. This app calculates shape metrics and creates graphs with export features to save.

---

## Features

- **Supports classic shapes**: Circle, Ellipse, Triangle, Rectangle, Regular Polygon  
- **Custom shape builder**: Define any Irregular Polygon by typing or pasting vertex coordinates  
- **Spirals**: Includes Archimedean, Logarithmic, Fermat, and Hyperbolic spirals, with arc length, final radius, and coordinates  
- **Graph saving**: Save graphs individually or a combined graph with metrics  
- **Batch export**: Save all or selected shapes in one click  (exports graphs with attached metrics to a new folder)
- **Comparison mode**: Compare geometric properties and see differences across multiple shapes  
- **Golden Ratio detection**: Highlights when dimensions are close to œÜ (1.618...)  
- **Side-by-side View**: Shows all graphs and metrics next to eachother in a scrollable canvas
